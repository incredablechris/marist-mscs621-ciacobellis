# Project Introduction with Background History

Please refer to the README.md [document](https://github.com/incredablechris/marist-mscs621-ciacobellis/blob/master/README.md) for this project after understanding this context.

* _Background for this Decision_: This past June, I had accepted an offer for a Summer Internship at IBM. I was placed on the IBM Learning Skills Gateway Team and for the next three months, I was to learn everything related to IBM Learning.

- The IBM Learning Skills Gateway team focuses teaching skills to users around the world. These skills encompass almost anything to leading technology, including (but not limited to) *Analytics*, *Cloud Computing*, *Blockchain*, *Security*, *IT Infrastructure*, and *Watson services.*

- Check out our front-end [site](https://www-03.ibm.com/services/learning/itesp.wss/zz-en?pageType=page&c=a0011023) to learn more about my team.

* After those three months, I can truly affirm that I have appreciated my time here at IBM with my team and the company overall. So much so in fact, that at the end of the internship, I was offered a full time position (starting in January). Until then, the internship would be extended. Since I have had such an excellent experience with IBM, I figured I'd focus my Cloud Computing project on technologies that I have used at IBM thus far.

* Of these topics, my favorite Cloud technologies have been **Db2**, **Cloud Object Store**, and **Secure Gateway**.


## Definitions

_Db2_: As defined on the IBM Analytics [site](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/db2/), Db2 "includes products for operational databases, data warehouses, data lakes and fast data." Essentially, Db2 is a relational database that delivers advanced data management and analytics capabilities for a users transactional and warehousing workloads. The database offers features of high performance, insights, data availability, and reliability. 

- For example: For the Learning Skills Gateway team at IBM, Db2 is our primary database system. It allows the Database Administrator (DBA) to create schemas and tables, which hold data. Data is stored in rows and columns on a Db2 server. There are a few types of Db2 servers (including *Db2 Managed* and *Db2 Hosted*), which we will discuss later in this project. To access this data, typically a user will need access to the database _hostname_, _public IP address_, the _port_, _database type_, a _username_, and a _password_. These are all configured upon initially creating a Db2 

_Cloud Object Store_: IBM Cloud Object Storage is a scalable storage tool that is commonly used for data archiving and backup, web and mobile applications, and analytics. Cloud Object Storage (COS) offers a Flex scalable plan; meaning that the size of storage can increase over time as more objects and data are stored in a single instance (or bucket).
