# Project Introduction with Background History

Please refer to the README.md document  for this project

* _Background for this Decision_: This past June, I had accepted an offer for a Summer Internship at IBM. I was placed on the IBM Learning Skills Gateway Team and I have truly appreciated the time with my team and the company thus far. At the end of the internship, I was offered a full time position (starting in January), and until then an extension of the internship. Since I have had such an excellent experience with IBM, I figured I'd focus my Cloud Computing project on technologies that I have used at IBM thus far.
* Of these topics, my favorite Cloud technologies have been **Db2**, **Cloud Object Store**, and **Secure Gateway**.
