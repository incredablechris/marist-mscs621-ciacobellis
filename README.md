# MSCS621 Fall 2018 â€“ Cloud Computing Project

developed and documented by Christopher Iacobellis

Marist College, Class of 2018

BS, MS Information Technology

## Fundamental Introduction
 Introduction to an application (what it does, how it helps, dependencies, and so on)
 
The project that I have researched and implemented for this semester relates to Databases, Object Store, and Secure Gateway, all under the IBM Cloud Platform and Service. 

Please refer to Project Background Description.md for a full background description by following the path below:
      
      marist-mscs621-ciacobellis/Project Background Description.md
      
- or view the page [here](https://github.com/incredablechris/marist-mscs621-ciacobellis/blob/master/Project%20Background%20Description.md).

As such, my project for this course will highlight and implement:

1. **Db2Hosted and Db2Managed on Cloud Database**
2. **IBM Cloud Object Store**
3. **Secure Gateway**

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### What the Application does:

For this project I will be using three separate IBM Cloud services | systems. The overall application ecosystem will:

1. Successfully implement a Db2 Managed Cloud database 
2. Connect this Managed Cloud Database with a Cloud Object Store. The Object Store will hold metadata.
3. Establishe a Secure Gateway link to effectively migrate data from a legacy database server to a Cloud Managed instance.

## Deploy Application
+ how to deploy your application

## Architecture Diagram
 + Architecture diagram (local cloud development, cloud deployment, communication)
 
## API's
 + API specification if your service is consumed by others
 
## GitHub Pages
 * Github pages site where the high level introduction under <master-branch>/docs (i.e.
marketing, sales)

## URL

Since this application ecosystem will be hosted on the IBM Cloud Bluemix Dashboard, the link is similar to that of which we have used in class this semester. The Dashboard hosts IBM Cloud Foundry Applications and Cloud Foundry Services, which can be interconnected with each other. As such, a user can create a *Db2 Managed Database Cloud Foundry service*, a *Cloud Object Storage service*, and a *Secure Gateway Cloud Foundry service* 

You will find the link below. You may need to create an IBMid if not already done so.

## Create a FINAL REPORT
- The final report (ppt) should include the architecture, components, deployment model,
communication, and so on.
