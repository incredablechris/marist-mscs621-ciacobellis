Marist College, Class of 2018

BS, MS Information Technology

## Fundamental Introduction
 Introduction to an application (what it does, how it helps, dependencies, and so on)
 
The project that I have researched and implemented for this semester relates to the IBM Db2 Cloud Database System, IBM Cloud Object Store, and Secure Gateway. 

Please refer to file Project Introduction | Background.md for a full background description by following the path below:

View the page [here](https://github.com/incredablechris/marist-mscs621-ciacobellis/blob/master/Project%20Background%20Description.md)

As such, my project for this course will highlight and implement:

1. **Db2Hosted and Db2Managed on Cloud Database**
2. **IBM Cloud Object Store**
3. **Secure Gateway**

### What the Application does:

For this project I will be using three separate IBM Cloud services | systems. The overall application ecosystem will successfully implement a Db2 Cloud database, linking to a Object Store [ also in the Cloud ] ****.......











## Deploy Application
+ how to deploy your application

## Architecture Diagram
 + Architecture diagram (local cloud development, cloud deployment, communication)
 
## API's
 + API specification if your service is consumed by others
 
## GitHub Pages
 * Github pages site where the high level introduction under <master-branch>/docs (i.e.
marketing, sales)

## URL
- The URL for the running application (Note: please make sure you shut cloud instances down
after the course, otherwise it will charge you after the free tier ends. I will send a notification
after all done). 

## Create a FINAL REPORT
- The final report (ppt) should include the architecture, components, deployment model,
communication, and so on.
