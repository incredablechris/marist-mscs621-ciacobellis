# MSCS621 Fall 2018 â€“ Cloud Computing Project

developed and documented by Christopher Iacobellis

Marist College, Class of 2018

BS, MS Information Technology

## Introduction
 Introduction to an application (what it does, how it helps, dependencies, and so on)
 
The project that I have researched and implemented for this semester relates to the IBM Db2 Cloud Database System, IBM Cloud Object Store, and Secure Gateway. 

* _Background for this Decision_: This past June, I had accepted an offer for a Summer Internship at IBM. I was placed on the IBM Learning Skills Gateway Team and I have truly appreciated the time with my team and the company thus far. At the end of the internship, I was offered a full time position (starting in January), and until then an extension of the internship. Since I have had such an excellent experience with IBM, I figured I'd focus my Cloud Computing project on technologies that I have used at IBM thus far.
* Of these topics, my favorite Cloud technologies have been **Db2**, **Cloud Object Store**, and **Secure Gateway**.

As such, my project for this course will highlight and implement:

1. **Db2Hosted and Db2Managed on Cloud Database**
2. **IBM Cloud Object Store**
3. **Secure Gateway**

## Deploy Application
+ how to deploy your application

## Architecture Diagram
 + Architecture diagram (local cloud development, cloud deployment, communication)
 
## API's
 + API specification if your service is consumed by others
 
## GitHub Pages
 * Github pages site where the high level introduction under <master-branch>/docs (i.e.
marketing, sales)

## URL
- The URL for the running application (Note: please make sure you shut cloud instances down
after the course, otherwise it will charge you after the free tier ends. I will send a notification
after all done). 

## Create a FINAL REPORT
- The final report (ppt) should include the architecture, components, deployment model,
communication, and so on.
