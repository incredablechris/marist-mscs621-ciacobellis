# Cloud Object Store Configuration

To configure Cloud Object Store, the user will need to log in to the [IBM Cloud Dashboard](https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps) and create an instance of Object Storage.

Like Secure Gateway and DB2Managed, the Object Store configuration steps mainly occur in the IBM Cloud GUI itself. For the easiest instructions, I've provided a link to my [Final Report](https://github.com/incredablechris/marist-mscs621-ciacobellis/blob/master/final_project/Iacobellis_Final_PPT.pdf) with the corresponding steps and screen captures.
